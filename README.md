## 🧪 Featured Projects & Labs

### 🛠️ Kali Linux Penetration Testing Lab  
Simulated ethical hacking scenarios using tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and OpenVAS to uncover and report vulnerabilities in test environments.

### 📡 Wireshark Traffic Analysis  
Captured and analyzed packet data to detect anomalies (e.g., DDoS, port scans, ARP spoofing). Created custom filters to flag malicious activity.

### 📊 Splunk SIEM Monitoring  
Configured a real-time dashboard using Splunk to aggregate logs from simulated network nodes, trigger alerts, and respond to suspicious behavior.

⏳ More labs and code-based security tools coming soon as I expand this portfolio.
